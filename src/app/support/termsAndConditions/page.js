                                i. Identity Check : Our team of experts see to
                                it that the right person gives the review. To
                                ensure this, they check upon the reviewer&apos;s
                                Name, Job Title, or Email Address. If the team
                                fails in verifying the reviewer&apos;s identity, we

                                the name and company of the reviewer against the
                                product he/she reviews. If in any way, he/she is
                                found associated with the vendor or identified
                                as a vendor&apos;s direct competitor, we won&apos;t
                                publish the review.

                                iii. Content Check : Each review gets evaluated
                                by our team of experts to ensure that it is
                                authentic and meets our quality standards. If

                                •Inappropriate, violent, or hateful language:
                                The review should not contain any obscene
                                language. Neither should it be bullying nor
                                discriminatory.
                                <br />• Spam: The review should not be
                                self-promoting or nonsensical

                                <br />• Invalid Reviewer: The vendor should
                                neither write reviews on behalf of the customers
                                nor hire reviewers towrite fake reviews. This
                                will be considered a fraud, and necessary
                                actions might be taken.

                                such clause is viewed as an attempt to inflate
                                reviews or ratings by Flourishersedge. If any
                                vendor involves such clauses to inflate the
                                reviews/ratings, penalties will apply to the
                                vendor&apos;s portal. Also, we reserve the right to
                                take down reviews on that basis.

                                ii. Vendors must not review their or a
                                competitors product Flourishersedge strictly
                                prohibits vendors from reviewing their own
                                product or posting a review on the customer&apos;s
                                behalf. More so over, vendors must not post any
                                reviews that direct any kind of strategic or
                                financial benefit.Vendors are not allowed to
                                collect a host of reviews for our site. Only the

                                via the review form. We do not allow vendors to
                                review their competitor&apos;s product even though it
                                is based on the actual experience of using the
                                product.

                                iii. Vendors must not harass reviewers based on
                                their ratings or reviews Vendors are encouraged
                                to respond constructively to the reviews on our
                                site with the “reply” feature within the Vendors
                                Portal. The responses must be respectful and may
                                not contain any abusing, violent, or harassing
                                language. However, vendors are not allowed to
                                contact the reviewer directly or indirectly
                                regarding the content of a review.

                                investigation service At Flourishersedge, we
                                would be happy to investigate reviews flagged as
                                violating our Review Guidelines. However, if we
                                have a reason to suspect that the vendor is
                                trying to abuse our system by unnecessarily
                                flagging reviews for investigation, we may, at
                                our discretion, impose penalties on the vendor&apos;s
                                account.

                                all vendors regardless of their account status.
                                Any violation of these guidelines is subject to
                                penalties imposed by Flourishersedge and the
                                law. We reserve the right to decide the
                                penalties, which may include a comment on
                                Vendor&apos;s profile or suspension of services.
